# News_Scraper
i have made scraper using python , which scrapes articles from News sites such as CNBC and FinanceTimes based on certain keywords and in between specified date.
prerequisite:-
signin id for scraping articles from FT
make sure you create a csv file naming CNBCScraper.csv and FTScraper.csv 

since, i didn't have signid of FinanceTimes so i just made a program to get links from pages and if it meets the requirement of data(keywords and date) i will open the window and write it into csv file

required modules:- selenium  
webdriver :- chrome webdriver as per your chrome version
